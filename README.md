# search_ai
An AI developed over the course of a month. The AI is able to search a giving area, navigating its way around obstacles and narrowing down its search over several generations to optimize its path.

This AI was developed at UCSC for CMPM 146 - Game AI on a team of four. 
The AI uses a mixture of Rapidly Expanding Random Trees and a simple genetic algorithm
to be able to search a given space. The user is able to lay down obstacles to make 
the search space challenging for the AI. Once the AI found its destination, it uses
a simple fitness function to update and evolve its path finding abilities. After 
several generations, the AI is able to find the most optimal path from start to
end.
